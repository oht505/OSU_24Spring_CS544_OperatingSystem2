Challenge (Extra credit 1%). Enhance the console to allow text to be printed in
different colors. The traditional way to do this is to make it interpret ANSI escape
sequences embedded in the text strings printed to the console, but you may use any
mechanism you like. There is plenty of information on the cs444/544 useful links page
(Canvas->Useful Links) and elsewhere on the web on programming the VGA display
hardware. If you’re feeling really adventurous, you could try switching the VGA
hardware into a graphics mode and making the console draw text onto the graphical
frame buffer.
To get 1% of credit, please create a command ‘show’ in the monitor and print a beautiful
ASCII Art with 5 or more colors when the command is typed on the console.
Once you finish this, please create a file .lab1-extra at the root of your repository
directory (under jos-labs-[username]/). We will use that file as an indicator that you
finished this extra-credit and then grade your work accordingly.

  When the word "show" is typed, the program will show 6 colors (Yellow ~ Blue).
